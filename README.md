# ðŸ¤– LangGraph AI Agentic System:

This project is a **modular LangGraph-based agentic system** built with [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain), [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), and Azure OpenAI . 

---

## ðŸš€ Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how **AI agents** can be combined with **external tools** and orchestrated using **LangGraph's workflow-based graph**. Specifically, it:
- The following projects involves conditional wokflows with LangGraph
- It includes two tool -- **Weather Tool** and **News tool** and they work conditionally
- Either of the one is triggered according to the intent of the **Human Response**
- Makes use of **LangChain's agentic tooling** and **LangGraph's conditional flows**
